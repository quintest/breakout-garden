# Breakout Garden

Software and examples for the Pimoroni [Breakout Garden](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/breakout-garden-hat), a simple way to build projects using [breakouts](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pimoroni-breakouts), with absolutely no soldering required.

## Installing

Breakout Garden doesn't require any software of its own, but each breakout you use will need a Python library.
install needed python libraries by typing:

`sudo apt-get install python-pip git`
`sudo pip install
This will install everything you need to follow along.

We've created a handy script to get you started:

1. Plug in all of your Breakout Garden-compatible breakouts
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/breakout-garden.git` to download software. 
3. Run `cd breakout-garden-master` to enter code folder. 
4. Run `sudo ./install.sh`
5. Step through the install process, (press Enter)
6. Enjoy!

## Examples

We've put together a few fun [examples](examples/) to show what's possible with Breakout Garden. Each example has its own README telling you about it, which breakouts are required, and about how to use it.
